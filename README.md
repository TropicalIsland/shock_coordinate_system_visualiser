# Conic Section Coordinate Visualiser

A small script to visualise conic sections in an x & r coordinate system in terms of a Radius, Bluntness, and two orthogonal oordinate directions as defined in The Supersonic Blunt Body Problem - Milton D. Van Dyke https://doi.org/10.2514/8.7744

You can play with R, B, eta, and eps to see the x,y path along with a radius circle with the option to trace their path
